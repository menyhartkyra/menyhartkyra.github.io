            <p>The current moment, not just political, is the most grim moment in human history. We are now in a situation where this generation, in fact, in the next few years, is going to have to make a decision of cosmic significance which has never arisen before: Will organized human society survive? And there are two enormous threats. The threat of environmental catastrophe, which at least is getting some attention, not enough. The other is the threat of nuclear war, which is increasing sharply by the Trump administration, in fact. These have to be dealt with quickly. Otherwise, there’s nothing to talk about.

            <dl>
                <dt>Logic gate</dt>
                <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; 
                    that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces
                     a single binary output.</dd>
                <dt>ASCII</dt>
                <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
                    Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation 
                    of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</dd>
                <dt>RAM</dt>
                <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase 
                    the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in 
                    almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</dd>
                <dt>Programming language</dt>
                <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to 
                    produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a
                     computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
                </dd>
                <dt>Domain Name System (DNS)</dt>
                <dd>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other 
                    resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various 
                    information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</dd>
                <dt>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</dt>
                <dd>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information 
                    systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is 
                    the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</dd>
